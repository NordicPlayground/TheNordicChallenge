						Each week the points for each club will be added up and then divided
						by the size of the office/location headcount. By doing it this way
						we make sure every activity counts positively against the challenge,
						no matter how short.
					</p>
					<p>
						In general activities will give a 1 km = 1 point ratio in the
						statistics, but we have some adjustments as described in this
						section.
					</p>
					<p>
						As biking/skiing is more efficient in km than running/walking, we
						will be using a ratio for this, and for each 3km cycled = 1 points.{' '}
					</p>
					<p>
						This ratio counts for the following activities: <b>Ride</b>,{' '}
						<b>Virtual Bike</b>, <b>Roller Ski</b>,<b> Nordic Ski</b>,{' '}
						<b>BackCountry Ski</b>, <b>Gravel Ride</b> and{' '}
						<b>Mountain Bike Ride</b>.
					</p>
					For the same reason, 1km of <b>swimming</b> equals 4 points.
					<p>
						<b> E-Bike Ride </b> has a 5 km = 1 points ratio.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b> Snowboard </b>
						and <b>Alpine Ski</b> is given 0 distance but will give points as an{' '}
						<b>activity without distance</b> as described below.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Activities without distance</b>; like <b>Yoga</b>,{' '}
						<b>WeightTraining</b> etc are given points based on time. The
						following formula shows how this is done:
					</p>
					<p>
						<b> Time [hours] * 5 points</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						This means that 1 hour of activity without distance is equivalent to
						5 points. 30 min of activity gives 2.5 points and so on.
